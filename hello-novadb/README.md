This template contains the very basic "Hello NovaDB" example to get started with NovaDB and Remix.

Initialize your React Router app using the template engine by running:

`npx create-react-router@latest --template noxum/novadb-reactrouter-examples/hello-novadb`

and follow the setup procedure. 

cd into your project folder and rename `.env.template` to `.env` and enter the api details you have recieved from us.

Then run `npm run dev`
